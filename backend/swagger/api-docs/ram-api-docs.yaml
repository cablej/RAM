      summary: List Relationships
      description: |
        This resource represents a collection of relationships for a given party for a specified list of
        relationship types. The other party attached to each relationship is also returned. It is optionally possible
        to filter the request to return just those relationships where a party is either the Subject or Delegate on
        that relationship.

        Note - this defintion needs more work, particularly the filters.

      description: |
        This resource identifies a single instance of a relationship.

        When creating a relationship -
          one of the parties may be unknown.  The consumer may
          specify the Identity.type to be an invitationCode and leave out the identity.idValue .../parties/InvitationCode//relationships....

          In this case RAM will create the the Party and associate the newly created Party to the newly created Relationship.  It will
          return a hypermedia link to this newly created Party.  This newly created party will be identified by a newly generated Invitation Code.

          One or both of the parties to a new relationship may not yet exist in RAM.  RAM will create these parties as a side effect to creating
          the relationship - as long as the the logged on user has the authority.  This authority may be because either: they are the party that
          needs to be created (as identified by the authentication process), or they are some trusted party (e.g. agency staff).

          Just like the unknown party, the new party(s) are created and a hypermedia reference return to it along with the new relationship.

        Note, an Identity in the put/ posted payload may contain a profile which may contain a name, etc. which will result init being updated.

        This service may be use to find a party with the specified invitation code (sub type of identity) and update details of that invitation
        code to signal it has been accepted, rejected, etc.
        If the supplied invitation code details are correct, the status & claimedtimestamp propertie are update.
        The link id for the logged on user is populated into the identity property (together with profile info).
        This identity is used to find a Party record for the logged on user.
        if one is found the Relationship attached to the Party that contains the InvitationCode
        is transfered to the Party identified by the logged on user's Party
        if one isn't found the Identity for the logged on user is attached to the Party that
        owns the InvitationCode, and thus now the logged on user has a Party record.
